# ParTy-1.0
Parallel Corpus for Typology

This repository contains automatically aligned subtitles of films in different languages. The subtitles are aligned with the English version with the help of JÃ¶rg Tiedemann's software subalign. Some alignments have been manually checked, but this work is still in progress.

In addition, the folder "Originals" contains the original subtitles downloaded from opensubtitles.org in English, Chinese, Latvian and Lithuanian for specific projects.
