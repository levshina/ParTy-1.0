
1
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,548
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,724
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:28,939
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

4
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,444
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

5
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,578
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

6
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,293
What is the most resilient parasite?

7
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,921
A bacteria? A virus?

8
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,756
An intestinal worm?

9
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,341
Uh...

10
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,135
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say --

11
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,511
An idea.

12
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,307
Resilient. Highly contagious.

13
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,476
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

14
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,190
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

15
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,609
Right in there somewhere.

16
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,319
For someone like you to steal?

17
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,447
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

18
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,033
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

19
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,451
It's called extraction.

20
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,163
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

21
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,832
...from even the most skilled extractor.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,167
How can you do that?

23
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,170
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

24
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,049
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

25
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,135
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

26
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,638
...your defense is never down.

27
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,476
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

28
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,979
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

29
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,482
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,568
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

31
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,071
...I need to know what's in that safe.

32
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,699
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

33
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:10,207
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

34
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,710
He knows.

35
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,215
What's going on up there?

36
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,063
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

37
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,816
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

38
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,484
The information is in the safe.

39
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,820
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

40
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,239
What's she doing here?

41
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,037
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

42
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,247
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

43
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:45,343
If I jumped, would I survive?

44
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,098
With a clean dive, perhaps.

45
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,933
Mal, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,311
I thought you might be missing me.

47
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,771
You know that I am.

48
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,775
But I can't trust you anymore.

49
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,902
So what?

50
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,655
Looks like Arthur's taste.

51
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,451
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

52
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,871
Please, have a seat.

53
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,047
Tell me...

54
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,007
...do the children miss me?

55
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,055
You can't imagine.

56
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,310
What are you doing?

57
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,020
Just getting some fresh air.

58
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,189
Stay where you are, Mal.

59
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,746
Goddamn it.

60
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,185
Turn around.

61
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,394
The gun, Dom.

62
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,779
Please.

63
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,252
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

64
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,089
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

65
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:33,470
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

66
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,976
I want to know the name
of your employer.

67
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,857
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

68
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,485
That depends
on what you're threatening.

69
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,571
Killing him would just wake him up.

70
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,490
But pain...

71
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,329
Pain is in the mind.

72
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,251
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

73
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,765
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

74
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,352
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

75
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,537
He was close. Very close.

76
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,428
Stop him!

77
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,414
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

78
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,187
He won't wake.

79
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,942
- Give him the kick.
- What?

80
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,527
Dunk him.

81
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,448
He's out.

82
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,789
You came prepared, hmm?

83
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,793
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

84
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,172
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

85
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,883
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

86
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,010
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

87
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,180
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

88
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,142
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

89
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,978
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

90
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,314
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

91
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,359
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

92
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,488
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

93
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,366
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

94
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,077
But your deception was obvious.

95
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:11,372
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

96
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,793
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

97
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,087
We won't last two days.

98
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,216
Cobb?

99
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,552
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

100
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,473
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

101
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,729
I've always hated this carpet.

102
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,234
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

103
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,072
But very definitely made of wool.

104
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,616
Right now...

105
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,078
...I’m lying on polyester.

106
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,795
Which means I’m not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

107
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,924
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

108
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,426
I'm still dreaming.

109
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,935
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

110
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:23,444
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

111
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,199
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

112
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,618
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

113
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,203
We're not in your dream.

114
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,955
We're in mine.

115
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,967
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

116
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,469
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

117
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,763
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

118
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,015
That's enough.

119
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,642
You. What the hell was all that?

120
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,021
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

121
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,983
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

122
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,985
He's not gonna check every compartment.

123
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,778
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

124
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,698
Listen. Every man for himself.

125
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,065
Yes, hello?

126
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,901
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.

127
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,030
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

128
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,408
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.

129
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,328
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

130
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,416
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

131
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:47,046
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

132
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,548
Why?

133
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:54,429
Look, I told you, I’m away
because I’m working, right?

134
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,598
Grandma says you're never coming back.

135
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,143
Phillipa, is that you?

136
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,438
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

137
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,314
She's shaking her head.

138
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,944
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

139
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,029
Daddy?

140
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:13,781
Yeah, James?

141
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,616
Is Mommy with you?

142
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,455
James, we talked about this.

143
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:24,083
Mommy's not here anymore.

144
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,377
Where?

145
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,756
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

146
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,968
Listen, I’m gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

147
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,136
And you be good, you be --

148
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,857
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

149
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,199
Hey, are you okay?

150
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,242
Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. Why?

151
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,828
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

152
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,248
Look, I’m, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

153
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,002
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?

154
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,671
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

155
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,299
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

156
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,218
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

157
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,638
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

158
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,682
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

159
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,103
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

160
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,480
Stateside.

161
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,190
Send my regards.

162
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,075
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

163
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,037
So I offer you the satisfaction.

164
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,544
It's not the way I deal with things.

165
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,684
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

166
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,562
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

167
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,079
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

168
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,083
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

169
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,460
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

170
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,504
...why can't you plant one there instead?

171
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,756
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

172
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,260
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

173
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,428
Elephants.

174
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,764
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

175
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,934
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

176
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,313
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

177
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,943
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

178
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,779
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

179
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,990
Then you do have a choice.

180
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,950
Then I choose to leave, sir.

181
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,540
Tell the crew where you want to go.

182
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,880
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

183
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,135
How would you like to go home?

184
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:25,222
To America. To your children.

185
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,976
You can't fix that. No one can.

186
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,396
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

187
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,028
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

188
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,740
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

189
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,661
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

190
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,581
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

191
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,044
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

192
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,422
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

193
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,761
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

194
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,846
...I’d need a guarantee.

195
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,266
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

196
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,352
But I can.

197
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:16,524
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

198
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,778
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

199
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,531
...waiting to die alone?

200
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,913
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

201
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,881
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

202
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,386
This can't be done.

203
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,848
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

204
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,558
You don't know that.

205
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,728
I've done it before.

206
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,105
Who'd you do it to?

207
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,362
Why are we going to Paris?

208
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,657
We're gonna need a new architect.

209
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,634
You never did like your office, did you?

210
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,473
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

211
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,602
Is it safe for you to be here?

212
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,230
Extradition between France
and the United States...

213
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,608
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

214
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,527
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

215
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,199
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

216
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,951
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

217
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,121
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

218
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,124
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

219
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,793
I never taught you to be a thief.

220
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,170
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

221
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,630
But after what happened...

222
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,383
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

223
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,015
What are you doing here, Dom?

224
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,520
I think I found a way home.

225
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,273
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

226
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,903
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

227
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,988
But I need your help.

228
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,992
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

229
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,037
You know what I’m offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

230
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,664
- Money.
- Not just money.

231
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,165
You remember.

232
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,585
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

233
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,504
...things that never existed...

234
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,882
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

235
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:52,221
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

236
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,348
They don't actually come into the dream.

237
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,810
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

238
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,186
Design it yourself.

239
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,357
Mal won't let me.

240
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,699
Come back to reality, Dom.

241
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,619
- Please.
- Reality.

242
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,539
Those kids, your grandchildren...

243
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,710
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

244
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,046
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

245
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,217
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

246
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,307
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

247
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,521
I've got somebody better.

248
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,731
Ariadne?

249
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,861
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

250
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,362
Pleased to meet you.

251
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,200
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

252
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,410
A work placement?

253
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,078
Not exactly.

254
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,580
I have a test for you.

255
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,416
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

256
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,210
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

257
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,589
- Why?
- It’s not, strictly speaking, legal.

258
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,347
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

259
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,433
Stop.

260
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,062
Again.

261
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,523
Stop.

262
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,779
You're gonna have to do better than that.

263
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,043
That's more like it.

264
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,149
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

265
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,985
Now, that's when we're awake.

266
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,154
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

267
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,322
Such as?

268
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,493
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

269
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,497
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

270
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,666
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

271
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,085
Genuine inspiration, right?

272
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,588
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

273
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,385
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

274
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,972
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

275
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,850
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

276
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,394
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

277
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,187
Now, this is where I need you.

278
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,732
You create the world of the dream.

279
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:55,279
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

280
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:00,117
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

281
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,746
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

282
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,624
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

283
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,502
Let me ask you a question.

284
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,048
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

285
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,259
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

286
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,469
I guess, yeah.

287
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,220
So how did we end up here?

288
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,681
Well, we just came from the, uh...

289
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,310
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

290
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,812
Where are you right now?

291
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,275
We're dreaming?

292
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,903
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

293
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,031
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

294
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,487
If it's just a dream,
then why are you -- ?

295
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,865
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

296
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,327
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

297
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,704
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

298
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,583
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

299
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,876
...and then wake up.

300
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,962
How did architects become involved?

301
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,881
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

302
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,300
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

303
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:46,306
Five minutes? What -- ? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

304
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,725
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

305
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,728
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

306
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,274
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

307
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,069
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

308
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,911
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

309
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,746
Almost everything else is here too.

310
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,833
Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

311
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,168
- Yours?
- Yes.

312
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,879
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

313
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,715
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

314
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,800
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

315
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,845
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

316
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,305
How else do you do it?

317
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:30,475
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

318
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,354
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

319
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,316
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

320
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:38,525
Well...

321
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:43,197
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

322
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,199
...but it's more about the feel of it.

323
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,828
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

324
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,746
It's something, isn't it?

325
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,123
Yes, it is.

326
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,607
Why are they all looking at me?

327
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,278
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

328
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,740
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

329
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,950
Converge?

330
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,202
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

331
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,038
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

332
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,041
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

333
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,127
Just you.

334
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,343
This is great, but I’m telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

335
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,808
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

336
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,644
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

337
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,699
Very impressive.

338
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,964
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

339
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,467
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

340
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,054
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

341
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,056
You draw from stuff you know, right?

342
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:00,435
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

343
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,729
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

344
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,400
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

345
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,652
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

346
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,821
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

347
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,948
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

348
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,659
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

349
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,452
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

350
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,579
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

351
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,165
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

352
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,126
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

353
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,794
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

354
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,425
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

355
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,803
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

356
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,721
There was still time on the clock.

357
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,433
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

358
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,184
-- She'll need a totem.
- What?

359
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,811
A totem, it's a small personal --

360
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,522
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

361
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,524
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

362
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,318
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

363
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:54,239
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

364
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,867
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

365
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,285
- Like a coin?
- No.

366
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:03,123
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

367
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,127
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

368
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,465
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

369
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,467
That way,
when you look at your totem...

370
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,761
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

371
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,478
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

372
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,190
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

373
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:32,319
And I’m not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

374
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,828
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

375
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,500
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...

376
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,836
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

377
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,297
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

378
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,592
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

379
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,344
It's a necessary risk.

380
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,014
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

381
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,183
We need a forger.

382
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,444
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

383
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,029
You never know.

384
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,032
I'm gonna get you a drink.

385
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,536
You're buying.

386
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,336
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

387
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,463
How's your handwriting?

388
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,465
- It’s versatile.
- Good.

389
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,883
Thank you very much.

390
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,885
Inception.

391
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,972
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me--

392
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,433
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

393
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,895
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

394
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,274
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

395
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,150
He is good at what he does, right?

396
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,403
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

397
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,571
Not like you.

398
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,740
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

399
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,452
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

400
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,248
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

401
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,751
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

402
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,920
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

403
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,757
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It’s a subtle art.

404
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,468
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

405
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,848
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

406
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,434
Right there you have
various political motivations...

407
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,603
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

408
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,605
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

409
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,649
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

410
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,319
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

411
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,070
Which is what?

412
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,448
The relationship with the father.

413
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,327
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

414
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,580
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

415
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,167
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

416
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,627
Why don't you take me there?

417
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,880
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

418
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,506
Cobol Engineering.

419
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,009
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

420
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,720
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

421
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,515
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

422
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,684
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

423
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:13,563
All right.

424
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,566
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

425
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,193
My God, it's you, isn't it?

426
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,822
No, it isn't you.

427
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,407
Not dreaming now, are you?

428
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,203
Get him!

429
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,844
There!

430
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,117
One café.

431
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,622
Shh.

432
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,713
One café.

433
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,215
One café.

434
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,271
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

435
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,985
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I’m here to protect my investment.

436
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,449
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

437
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,617
Different tail.

438
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,085
Cobb said you'd be back.

439
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,757
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

440
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,592
It's just...

441
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:50,428
...pure creation.

442
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,097
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

443
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,266
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

444
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,978
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

445
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,563
What kind of tricks?

446
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,234
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

447
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:08,321
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

448
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,656
The infinite staircase.

449
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,328
See?

450
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,542
Paradox.

451
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,126
So a closed loop like that...

452
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,380
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

453
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,507
But how big do these levels have to be?

454
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,843
It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.

455
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,430
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

456
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,015
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

457
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,517
And the better the maze...

458
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,353
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

459
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,813
Exactly.

460
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,692
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

461
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,195
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

462
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,447
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

463
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,118
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

464
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,704
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

465
00:40:57,871 --> 00:40:58,955
Why?

466
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,374
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

467
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,085
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

468
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,422
- They're still together?
- No.

469
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,174
No, she's dead.

470
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,887
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

471
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,892
What was she like in real life?

472
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,936
She was lovely.

473
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,151
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

474
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,445
To formulate compounds for a job?

475
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,989
And to go into the field with us.

476
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,408
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

477
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,287
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

478
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,581
- Which are?
- Great depth.

479
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,001
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

480
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,796
Three.

481
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,550
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

482
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,679
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

483
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,515
A powerful sedative.

484
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,561
- How many team members?
- Five.

485
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,438
Six.

486
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,360
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

487
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,613
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

488
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,157
This time, it seems there is.

489
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,828
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

490
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,122
What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

491
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,170
Perhaps you will not want to see.

492
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,716
After you.

493
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,020
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

494
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,980
They come every day to share the dream.

495
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:53,569
You see? Very stable.

496
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:03,329
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

497
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,664
In dream time?

498
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,501
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

499
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,963
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

500
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,925
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

501
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,010
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

502
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,056
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.

503
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,519
They come to be woken up.

504
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,815
The dream has become their reality.

505
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,110
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

506
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,030
Let's see what you can do.

507
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,626
You know how to find me.

508
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,214
You know what you have to do.

509
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,554
Sharp, no?

510
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,947
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

511
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,243
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

512
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,422
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

513
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,466
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

514
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,259
That's not your concern.

515
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:45,014
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

516
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,766
You asked me for inception.

517
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,311
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

518
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,440
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

519
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,484
This idea will define him.

520
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,486
It may come to change...

521
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,947
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

522
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:05,451
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

523
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,703
And we can no longer compete.

524
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,332
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

525
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,876
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

526
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,631
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

527
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,341
That's where we come in.

528
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,803
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

529
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,681
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

530
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,350
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

531
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,728
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

532
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:37,066
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

533
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,486
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

534
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:45,157
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

535
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,703
I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

536
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,996
Mr. Browning...

537
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:54,000
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

538
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:01,007
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

539
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:02,592
Not sure that's necessary.

540
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,428
No, no, no. I think we should.

541
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,284
How is he?

542
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,871
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but --

543
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:37,543
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn -- Wait. So do it. Get --

544
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,880
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

545
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,884
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

546
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,845
Leave that.

547
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,892
Here.

548
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,563
Must be a cherished memory of his.

549
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,235
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

550
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,071
Robert...

551
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,825
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

552
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,287
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

553
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,085
The vultures are circling.

554
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:23,673
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

555
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,258
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

556
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:31,263
...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

557
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:35,267
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

558
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,688
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

559
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,690
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

560
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,360
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

561
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,445
So he gives himself the idea.

562
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,866
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

563
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,453
Eames, I am impressed.

564
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:58,165
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

565
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,522
Were you going under on your own?

566
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,192
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

567
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,319
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

568
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,156
Yeah, I was just --
I was working on my totem, actually.

569
00:48:30,323 --> 00:48:31,490
Here, let me take a look.

570
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,994
So you're learning, huh?

571
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,664
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

572
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,667
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

573
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,003
It was Mal's, actually. This...

574
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,466
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

575
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,552
Just spin and spin.

576
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,014
Arthur told me she passed away.

577
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,018
How are the mazes coming along?

578
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,063
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

579
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,689
...that we are trying to access.

580
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:09,320
So I’m making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

581
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,448
You know, I -- Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

582
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,369
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

583
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,704
Why is that so important?

584
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,873
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

585
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,375
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

586
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,213
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

587
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,799
You can't keep her out, can you?

588
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,218
- Right.
- You can't build...

589
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:35,721
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

590
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,057
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

591
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,060
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

592
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,437
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

593
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,564
No one said it's getting worse.

594
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,069
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

595
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,988
Why can't you go home?

596
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,119
Because they think I killed her.

597
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,624
- Thank you.
- For what?

598
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,085
For not asking whether I did.

599
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,420
"I will split up my father's empire."

600
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:12,800
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

601
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,761
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

602
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,473
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

603
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,435
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

604
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,021
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

605
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,775
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

606
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,695
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

607
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,448
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

608
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,119
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

609
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,206
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

610
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,127
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

611
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,129
All right, well, try this. Um...

612
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,050
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

613
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:56,510
That might work.

614
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,847
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

615
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,974
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

616
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,102
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

617
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,395
Specificity?

618
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,397
Inception's not about being specific.

619
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,526
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

620
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,822
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

621
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,075
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

622
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,914
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

623
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,417
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

624
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,003
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.

625
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,342
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

626
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:37,676
Sedation.

627
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,679
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

628
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,767
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

629
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,279
Good night.

630
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,074
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

631
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,201
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

632
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,580
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

633
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,875
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

634
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,587
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

635
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,881
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20 --

636
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,926
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

637
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,762
It's a week, the first level down.

638
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,307
Six months the second level down,
and the third level --

639
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,892
That's 10 years.

640
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,730
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

641
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,274
Depends on the dream.

642
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,734
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

643
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,238
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

644
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,199
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

645
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,077
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

646
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,915
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

647
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,294
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

648
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,670
That's the clever part.

649
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,090
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

650
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:03,095
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

651
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,597
Or tipping.

652
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,436
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

653
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,481
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

654
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,868
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

655
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,037
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

656
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:31,457
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need--

657
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:33,542
We need at least a good 10 hours.

658
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,044
Sydney to Los Angeles.

659
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,632
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

660
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,968
He must be flying private, then.

661
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,638
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

662
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,058
It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

663
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,684
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

664
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,063
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

665
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,733
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

666
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,485
I bought the airline.

667
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,821
It seemed neater.

668
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,242
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

669
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,038
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

670
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,213
You know how to find me.

671
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:04,133
You know what you have to do.

672
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,432
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

673
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,351
Of course I do.

674
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,938
You said you had a dream.

675
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,652
That we'd grow old together.

676
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,780
And we can.

677
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,414
You shouldn't be here.

678
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,629
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

679
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,008
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

680
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:51,972
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

681
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,277
Why do you do this to yourself?

682
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,363
It's the only way I can still dream.

683
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,326
Why is it so important to dream?

684
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,496
In my dreams, we're still together.

685
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,595
These aren't just dreams.

686
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,433
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

687
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,643
I know I did.

688
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,814
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

689
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,984
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

690
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,737
They're memories that I have to change.

691
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,449
Well, what's down there that you regret?

692
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:55,994
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

693
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,046
This is your house?

694
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,174
Mine and Mal's, yes.

695
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,051
Where is she?

696
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,720
She's already gone.

697
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,018
That's my son, James.

698
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,272
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

699
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,774
That's Phillipa.

700
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,193
I thought about calling out to them...

701
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,113
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

702
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:36,952
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

703
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,955
Right now or never, Cobb.

704
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,211
Then I start to panic.

705
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,089
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

706
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,259
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

707
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,928
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

708
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,139
But the moment's past.

709
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,728
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

710
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,772
As I’m about to call out to them...

711
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,899
...they run away.

712
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,905
If I’m ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

713
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,450
The real world.

714
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,493
What are you doing here?

715
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,453
My name is --

716
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,915
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

717
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,509
I'm just trying to understand.

718
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,803
How could you understand?

719
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,139
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

720
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,310
To be half of a whole?

721
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,105
No.

722
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,566
I'll tell you a riddle.

723
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,320
You're waiting for a train.

724
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,533
A train that will take you far away.

725
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,870
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

726
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,165
...but you don't know for sure.

727
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,251
But it doesn't matter.

728
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,630
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

729
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,549
Because you'll be together.

730
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:59,678
How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

731
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,265
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

732
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,766
What happened here?

733
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,521
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

734
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,023
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

735
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,402
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

736
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,029
I'll come back for you. I promise.

737
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:41,636
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

738
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,639
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

739
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,808
It's time.

740
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,395
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

741
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,731
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

742
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,151
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

743
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,778
All right.

744
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,406
- Cobb, I’m coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

745
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,743
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

746
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,456
And it doesn't have to be me...

747
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,918
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

748
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,425
Get us another seat on the plane.

749
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,516
lf I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

750
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:31,353
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

751
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,231
Complete the job en route...

752
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:36,858
...I make one phone call from the plane...

753
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,945
...you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

754
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,169
- I’m sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

755
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,921
Thank you.

756
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,833
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

757
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,877
Would you care for a drink?

758
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,336
Oh. Water, please.

759
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,839
Oh, um, same, please.

760
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,091
Um...

761
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,926
Thank you.

762
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,970
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

763
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:50,724
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

764
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,392
Yes, he, um...

765
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,353
He was my father.

766
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:59,816
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

767
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,446
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

768
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,947
Hey.

769
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,991
To your father.

770
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,827
May he rest in peace, huh?

771
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:21,606
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

772
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,817
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

773
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,110
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

774
01:04:25,277 --> 01:04:28,238
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

775
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:43,962
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try -- ?
- Walk away.

776
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,229
Just have him ca -- I gotta go.

777
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,523
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

778
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,320
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

779
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:12,240
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

780
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,908
- It’s not.
- Maybe we could share.

781
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,911
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this -- ?

782
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,207
Great.

783
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,630
Come on.

784
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,352
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

785
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,229
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

786
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,522
I'm afraid that it doesn't --

787
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,034
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!

788
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,827
What the hell is going on?

789
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,792
This wasn't in the design.

790
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,086
Cobb?

791
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,378
Cobb?

792
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,472
Get him!

793
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:07,605
Are you all right?

794
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,941
Yeah, I’m okay. I'm okay.

795
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,026
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

796
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,444
Saito?

797
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,465
Get Fischer in the back room now.

798
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,468
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

799
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,387
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

800
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,306
I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

801
01:07:41,473 --> 01:07:43,892
What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

802
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:46,019
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

803
01:07:46,186 --> 01:07:47,812
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

804
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,647
Why the hell were we ambushed?

805
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,233
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

806
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,945
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

807
01:07:56,113 --> 01:08:00,325
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

808
01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:02,118
It should've shown in the research.

809
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,078
Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

810
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,580
Don't tell me to calm down!

811
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,666
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

812
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,919
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

813
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:14,422
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

814
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,674
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

815
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,676
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

816
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,886
Put him out his misery.

817
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,889
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

818
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,183
He's in agony. I’m waking him up.

819
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,226
No. It won't wake him up.

820
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:31,022
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

821
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,440
Not from this.

822
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,151
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

823
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,445
Right. So, what happens when we die?

824
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,447
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

825
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,158
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

826
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,578
What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

827
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,957
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

828
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:52,043
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

829
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,087
Which, in our case, is just you.

830
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:56,965
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

831
01:08:57,132 --> 01:08:59,550
- ...trying to escape until the sedation --
- How long?

832
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,929
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

833
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,305
Let's get him upstairs.

834
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,392
Great.

835
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,894
Thank you.

836
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:13,815
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

837
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,441
And if we get killed...

838
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,861
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

839
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,578
Someone got first aid?

840
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,292
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

841
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,421
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

842
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:38,923
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

843
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,092
You knew about this
and went along with it?

844
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,301
I trusted him.

845
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,387
When? When he promised you
half his share?

846
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,807
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

847
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,059
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

848
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,646
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

849
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,732
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

850
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:59,944
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

851
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,447
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

852
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:05,074
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

853
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,118
I am sitting this one out on this level.

854
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,704
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

855
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,123
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

856
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:16,044
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

857
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:20,423
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

858
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,469
Downwards is the only way forwards.

859
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,138
Get ready.

860
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,474
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

861
01:10:34,354 --> 01:10:37,398
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

862
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,485
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

863
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:42,945
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

864
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:45,156
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

865
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,950
I don't know any safe.

866
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,995
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

867
01:10:52,664 --> 01:10:53,998
Tell us what it is.

868
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,584
I don't know.

869
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,674
We have it on good authority
you do know.

870
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,177
Yeah? Whose authority?

871
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,182
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

872
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:15,186
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

873
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,734
Useful?

874
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,528
Maybe.

875
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:25,780
You're on. You've got an hour.

876
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,198
An hour?

877
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,785
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

878
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,538
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

879
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:36,874
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

880
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:41,879
- What's that?
- Good authority.

881
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,802
Uncle Peter.

882
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,638
Just make them stop.

883
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,266
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

884
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:56,102
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

885
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,729
Just let me talk to him
and I’ll find out.

886
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,818
You have one hour. Start talking.

887
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,029
You all right?

888
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,241
You okay?

889
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,582
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

890
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,751
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

891
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,753
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

892
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,673
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

893
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,593
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

894
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:32,597
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

895
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:35,266
No, he never gave me any combination.

896
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,146
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

897
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,522
Well, what, then?

898
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,233
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

899
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:48,321
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

900
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,951
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

901
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,162
Perhaps after your mother died.

902
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,542
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

903
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,174
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

904
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,676
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

905
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,554
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

906
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,558
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

907
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,312
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

908
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,730
And if he dies?

909
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,358
Worst-case scenario?

910
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:28,236
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

911
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:32,490
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

912
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,325
I appreciate that, Saito.

913
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,579
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

914
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,790
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

915
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,710
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

916
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,504
Filled with regret?

917
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,048
Waiting to die alone.

918
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:50,841
No.

919
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,010
I'll come back.

920
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:56,514
And we'll be young men together again.

921
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,521
Breathe.

922
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,732
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

923
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,818
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

924
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,863
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

925
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,532
All right. What is in the safe?

926
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,784
Something for you.

927
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,539
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

928
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,376
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

929
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,752
That's an alternate.

930
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,297
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

931
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:32,091
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

932
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,970
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

933
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,597
Destroying my whole inheritance?

934
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,436
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

935
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,274
He loved you, Robert.

936
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,484
In his own way.

937
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,445
In his own way.

938
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,281
At the end...

939
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,743
...he called me in to his deathbed.

940
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,078
He could barely speak.

941
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:06,417
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

942
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,546
He pulled me close.

943
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:15,301
And I could only make out...

944
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,595
...one word.

945
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,267
"Disappointed."

946
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,107
When were you in limbo?

947
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,196
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

948
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,740
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

949
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:42,078
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

950
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:46,290
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

951
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,876
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

952
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,836
...we're also going deeper into you.

953
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:54,965
And I’m not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

954
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,429
We were working together.

955
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,266
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

956
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,726
I kept pushing things.

957
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,563
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

958
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:14,944
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

959
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,822
...that we could get trapped so deep...

960
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,992
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

961
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,121
...we lost sight of what was real.

962
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,754
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

963
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,383
We did that for years.

964
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,511
We built our own world.

965
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,556
How long were you stuck there?

966
01:16:44,724 --> 01:16:46,851
Something like 50 years.

967
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,397
Jesus.

968
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,025
How could you stand it?

969
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,945
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

970
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,157
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

971
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:05,703
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

972
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,288
And what about for her?

973
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,670
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

974
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:21,302
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

975
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,724
Limbo became her reality.

976
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:29,894
What happened when you woke up?

977
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:34,064
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

978
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,653
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

979
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,325
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

980
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,953
Eventually, she told me the truth.

981
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:51,749
She was possessed by an idea.

982
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:57,630
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

983
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,258
That our world wasn't real.

984
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:06,430
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

985
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,350
...that in order to get back home...

986
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,394
...we had to kill ourselves.

987
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,488
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

988
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,658
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

989
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:27,535
- I’m their mother!
- Calm down.

990
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:28,953
I can tell the difference.

991
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,455
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

992
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,332
You don't know you're dreaming!

993
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,709
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

994
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,713
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

995
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,719
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

996
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:52,393
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

997
01:19:18,461 --> 01:19:21,255
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

998
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:25,676
Just -- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

999
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:30,306
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1000
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:32,182
No, I'm not.

1001
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,435
Now, you listen to me.

1002
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,273
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1003
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,358
Now, just step back inside.

1004
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:44,278
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1005
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,363
We've talked enough.

1006
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,117
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1007
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,995
- ...or I’ll jump right now.
- Okay.

1008
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,043
We're gonna talk about this.

1009
01:19:59,919 --> 01:20:01,086
All right?

1010
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:06,342
- I’m asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1011
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,304
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1012
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,223
Take a second, think about our children.

1013
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,142
Think about James.

1014
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,519
Think about Phillipa, now.

1015
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,606
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1016
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,068
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1017
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:27,863
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1018
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,242
How you've threatened to kill me.

1019
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,665
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1020
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,583
Why did -- ? Why would you do this to me?

1021
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,628
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1022
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,839
We're going home to our real children.

1023
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:49,635
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1024
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,095
You're waiting for a train.

1025
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:55,182
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1026
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,351
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1027
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,355
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1028
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,732
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1029
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,111
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1030
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:11,115
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1031
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:12,700
Jesus Christ!

1032
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,957
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1033
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,294
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1034
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:25,713
So I ran.

1035
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,800
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1036
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:40,811
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1037
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,146
All right, let's go.

1038
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:46,483
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1039
01:21:47,026 --> 01:21:50,904
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1040
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,366
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1041
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:58,162
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1042
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:03,333
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1043
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,335
But you don't have to do that alone.

1044
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:07,755
- No, you're not...
- I’m doing it for the others.

1045
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:13,510
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1046
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,100
We have to move.

1047
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,685
Time's up.

1048
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,605
All right. I don't know any combination.

1049
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,858
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

1050
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,987
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1051
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:35,032
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1052
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,451
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1053
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,870
I said, right now! Right now!

1054
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,916
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1055
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,797
You'll have to do better than that.

1056
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:53,300
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1057
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,809
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1058
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,565
What'd you get?

1059
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:11,527
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1060
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:12,736
This helps us how?

1061
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,989
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1062
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,285
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I’m working on that.

1063
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:23,997
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1064
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:27,751
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1065
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:03,871
Damn it.

1066
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:07,040
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1067
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,810
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1068
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,981
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1069
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,483
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1070
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,653
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1071
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,156
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1072
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,825
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1073
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:43,660
Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1074
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:47,372
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1075
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,666
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1076
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,169
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

1077
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,839
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1078
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,008
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1079
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,302
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

1080
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,679
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1081
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,890
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1082
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,517
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1083
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:15,442
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1084
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,904
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1085
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,864
- You ready?
- Ready!

1086
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:23,200
Sweet dreams.

1087
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,285
Am I boring you?

1088
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:29,790
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1089
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,294
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1090
01:25:35,838 --> 01:25:37,422
There goes Mr. Charles.

1091
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:44,763
Mr. Fischer, right?

1092
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:48,433
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I --

1093
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:49,726
Hmm.

1094
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,562
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1095
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:56,942
In case you get bored.

1096
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:03,573
Must've blown you off.

1097
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:06,451
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1098
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:13,083
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1099
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,339
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500--

1100
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,632
About $500, right?

1101
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,760
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1102
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,887
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1103
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:29,766
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1104
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,268
And why don't you approve?

1105
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,437
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1106
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,772
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1107
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,859
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

1108
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,777
So now you've noticed how much time...

1109
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:43,613
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1110
01:26:45,324 --> 01:26:47,117
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1111
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,703
- I’m sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!

1112
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,330
You look a bit perkier.

1113
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:54,833
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1114
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,591
Turbulence on the plane?

1115
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:04,468
No, it's much closer.

1116
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:06,303
That's Yusuf's driving.

1117
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:17,105
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1118
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,357
Rod Green from marketing.

1119
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:21,151
But that's not true at all, is it?

1120
01:27:23,237 --> 01:27:26,698
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1121
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,867
I'm the head of your security down here.

1122
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,079
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1123
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:34,581
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1124
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:38,251
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1125
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,465
Security, huh?

1126
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,053
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1127
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:52,849
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1128
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,893
Subconscious security.

1129
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,187
You're talking about dreams?

1130
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:00,190
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1131
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,651
I am here to protect you.

1132
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,625
Mr. Fischer, I’m here
to protect you in the event...

1133
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:22,170
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1134
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:24,965
You're not safe here.

1135
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,384
They're coming for you.

1136
01:28:45,736 --> 01:28:47,779
Strange weather, isn't it?

1137
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:53,743
You feel that?

1138
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:56,913
What's happening?

1139
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:00,333
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1140
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:03,378
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1141
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:06,590
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1142
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,473
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1143
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:18,185
We should probably get out of here.

1144
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:37,037
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1145
01:29:37,204 --> 01:29:41,207
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1146
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:44,544
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1147
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,593
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1148
01:29:51,802 --> 01:29:55,847
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1149
01:29:56,682 --> 01:29:57,974
Yeah, I...

1150
01:29:58,142 --> 01:30:00,644
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1151
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:06,024
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I’m here to protect you. Go on.

1152
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:09,402
Mm-hm.

1153
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,032
- You're not real?
- No.

1154
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,577
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1155
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,829
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1156
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:22,916
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1157
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:26,336
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1158
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:28,463
Yeah.

1159
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:29,714
Okay.

1160
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:31,841
Okay.

1161
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,680
Can you get me out of here?

1162
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:40,183
Right away. Follow me.

1163
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:55,740
Hold on a second.

1164
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,539
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1165
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,958
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1166
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,711
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1167
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,715
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1168
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:27,063
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1169
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,315
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1170
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:32,986
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1171
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,320
...you may not wake up.

1172
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,743
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1173
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,747
You remember the training.

1174
01:31:44,915 --> 01:31:46,291
Remember what I said to you.

1175
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,334
Give me the gun.

1176
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,766
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1177
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,610
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1178
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:17,614
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1179
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:20,617
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1180
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,411
There was rain.

1181
01:32:23,954 --> 01:32:25,538
Uncle Peter.

1182
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:29,459
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1183
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,757
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1184
01:32:35,966 --> 01:32:38,009
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1185
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:40,470
It had something to do with, um...

1186
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,973
Something to do with a safe.

1187
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,226
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1188
01:32:46,393 --> 01:32:49,104
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1189
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:50,980
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1190
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,566
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1191
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:56,486
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1192
01:32:56,654 --> 01:33:00,240
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1193
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:02,033
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1194
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:05,954
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1195
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,832
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1196
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:12,794
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1197
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:16,714
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1198
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:19,717
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1199
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,219
Five.

1200
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,639
Five, two-- It was something,
it was a long number.

1201
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,891
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1202
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:28,101
Yep.

1203
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:32,313
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1204
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,775
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1205
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,069
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1206
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:42,198
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1207
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:45,535
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1208
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,121
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1209
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,541
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1210
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,545
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1211
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:58,882
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1212
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,764
They're with me. Go on.

1213
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:32,123
Mr. Charles.

1214
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,251
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1215
01:34:35,419 --> 01:34:37,503
They were trying to put you under.

1216
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,006
- I’m already under.
- Under again.

1217
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,759
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1218
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,803
Hey. I see you've changed.

1219
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,597
I'm sorry?

1220
01:34:48,098 --> 01:34:51,976
Oh, I’m sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1221
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,436
Oh.

1222
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,730
Good-looking fellow, I’m sure.

1223
01:34:56,398 --> 01:34:59,317
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1224
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,361
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1225
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,488
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1226
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:06,991
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1227
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,201
Shh.

1228
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,291
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1229
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:18,878
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1230
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,505
And you saw them torture him?

1231
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:29,889
The kidnappers are working for you?

1232
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:32,308
Robert.

1233
01:35:32,476 --> 01:35:36,312
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1234
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:40,984
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1235
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:43,486
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1236
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,824
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1237
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,661
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1238
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:53,788
That's his last insult.

1239
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:57,583
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1240
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:01,546
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1241
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:12,598
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I’m sorry.

1242
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:17,061
But he's wrong.

1243
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:20,440
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1244
01:36:20,607 --> 01:36:23,026
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1245
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:25,320
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1246
01:36:25,487 --> 01:36:28,239
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1247
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,869
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1248
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:39,500
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1249
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,211
All right.

1250
01:36:48,218 --> 01:36:49,469
He's out.
- Wait.

1251
01:36:49,636 --> 01:36:51,721
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1252
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,222
We're going into Fischer's.

1253
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,059
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1254
01:36:56,226 --> 01:36:58,561
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1255
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,313
That's right.

1256
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,565
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1257
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:05,068
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1258
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:08,237
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1259
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:14,660
You good?

1260
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:19,165
Hey. You ready?

1261
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,919
Yes, yes. I’m fine. I’m ready.

1262
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:36,808
Cobb?

1263
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,936
Cobb? What's down there?

1264
01:37:43,273 --> 01:37:45,900
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1265
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,944
I mean, what's down there for you?

1266
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,310
Did you see that?

1267
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:46,622
Eames, this is your dream.

1268
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:49,917
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1269
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,877
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

1270
01:40:52,045 --> 01:40:54,505
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1271
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:57,216
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1272
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:58,926
I could do it.

1273
01:40:59,344 --> 01:41:01,804
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1274
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:06,142
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1275
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,145
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1276
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:13,482
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1277
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:14,942
You're not coming in?

1278
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:17,445
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1279
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,656
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1280
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:22,992
Come on, Fischer!

1281
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:21,717
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1282
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:23,427
Move!

1283
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:26,055
Go!

1284
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:42,279
Sod it.

1285
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,126
I hope you're ready.

1286
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:05,636
No, it's too soon.

1287
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:13,352
Cobb, do you hear that?

1288
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,106
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

1289
01:43:17,607 --> 01:43:20,109
Yeah, I hear it. It’s music.

1290
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:21,694
So, what do we do?

1291
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,279
We move fast.

1292
01:43:28,785 --> 01:43:30,995
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1293
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:35,249
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1294
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,294
- Hey!
- That's him!

1295
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:40,671
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1296
01:43:40,839 --> 01:43:44,133
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1297
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:47,136
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1298
01:43:58,356 --> 01:43:59,982
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1299
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:02,651
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1300
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:04,403
Eames?

1301
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:28,761
Did Eames add any features?

1302
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,387
I don't think I should tell you.

1303
01:44:30,555 --> 01:44:32,848
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1304
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:34,558
He added an air-duct system...

1305
01:44:34,726 --> 01:44:36,477
- ...that can cut through the maze.
- Good. Explain it to them.

1306
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:13,722
Paradox.

1307
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,669
What was that?
- The kick.

1308
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:28,172
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1309
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:30,049
Yeah, we missed it.

1310
01:46:30,216 --> 01:46:31,425
Man.

1311
01:46:31,593 --> 01:46:35,888
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1312
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:37,306
Uh-huh.

1313
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,225
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1314
01:46:40,393 --> 01:46:42,227
We finish the job before the next kick.

1315
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:44,480
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1316
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,798
If you’d like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.

1317
01:47:10,965 --> 01:47:12,800
If you need help, hang up...

1318
01:47:13,009 --> 01:47:16,345
How do I drop you without gravity?

1319
01:47:18,848 --> 01:47:21,517
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1320
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:46,583
You okay?

1321
01:47:51,047 --> 01:47:54,925
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1322
01:47:55,093 --> 01:47:56,635
Go, go, go!

1323
01:47:58,805 --> 01:47:59,972
There's something wrong.

1324
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,474
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1325
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,936
Just buy us more time, all right?

1326
01:48:06,104 --> 01:48:07,938
- Come on!
- On my way.

1327
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:09,815
Come on! Move!

1328
01:49:33,983 --> 01:49:35,526
All right.

1329
01:49:47,705 --> 01:49:50,499
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1330
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:54,169
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1331
01:49:54,337 --> 01:49:56,588
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1332
01:49:58,216 --> 01:50:01,552
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1333
01:50:01,719 --> 01:50:05,097
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1334
01:50:31,374 --> 01:50:33,125
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1335
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:35,127
There's an entire army headed your way.

1336
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:03,322
I'm in.

1337
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,745
There he is.

1338
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:55,040
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1339
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:58,794
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1340
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:05,676
Cobb.

1341
01:52:06,302 --> 01:52:08,845
No, she is not real.

1342
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,681
How do you know that?

1343
01:52:10,848 --> 01:52:14,476
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1344
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:20,023
Hello.

1345
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,906
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1346
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:14,703
What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1347
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,999
I couldn't shoot her.

1348
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:23,045
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1349
01:53:23,212 --> 01:53:24,254
It's all over.

1350
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:27,632
So that's it, then? We failed?

1351
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:30,427
We're done. I'm sorry.

1352
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:36,933
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1353
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:41,563
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1354
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:43,774
Let's set the charges.

1355
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:47,110
No, there's still another way.

1356
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:51,823
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1357
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:54,826
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1358
01:53:55,953 --> 01:53:57,079
And we will find him.

1359
01:53:57,246 --> 01:54:01,166
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1360
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:04,252
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1361
01:54:05,254 --> 01:54:06,963
Look, you get him in there.

1362
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:10,008
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1363
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:12,969
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1364
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:18,934
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1365
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,228
Saito will never make it, will he?

1366
01:54:23,272 --> 01:54:25,732
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1367
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,819
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1368
01:54:28,986 --> 01:54:32,239
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1369
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:38,662
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1370
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,038
Mal's gonna be down there.

1371
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:42,624
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1372
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:46,711
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1373
01:54:46,879 --> 01:54:49,047
She wants me back down there with her.

1374
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:16,825
All right?

1375
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:26,751
- This is your world?
- It was.

1376
01:55:27,545 --> 01:55:29,504
And this is where she'll be.

1377
01:55:30,214 --> 01:55:31,256
Come on.

1378
01:56:18,262 --> 01:56:20,722
Saito. Saito.

1379
01:56:21,182 --> 01:56:25,143
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1380
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:28,730
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1381
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,567
Don't be silly.

1382
01:57:05,059 --> 01:57:07,102
You built all this? This is incredible.

1383
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:09,604
We built for years.

1384
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:12,649
Then we started in on the memories.

1385
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,116
This way.

1386
01:58:02,783 --> 01:58:04,868
This was our neighborhood.

1387
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:07,370
Places from our past.

1388
01:58:07,538 --> 01:58:09,330
That was our first apartment.

1389
01:58:09,498 --> 01:58:11,708
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1390
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:14,419
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1391
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:17,380
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1392
01:58:17,548 --> 01:58:19,841
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1393
01:58:20,009 --> 01:58:21,593
What is that?

1394
01:58:23,137 --> 01:58:24,888
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1395
01:58:25,056 --> 01:58:27,515
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1396
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:28,850
Come on.

1397
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:32,353
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1398
01:58:32,521 --> 01:58:35,482
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1399
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,066
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1400
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:20,902
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1401
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,487
What?

1402
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:24,572
I'm gonna improvise.

1403
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:29,410
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1404
01:59:42,508 --> 01:59:46,386
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1405
01:59:47,221 --> 01:59:48,763
Highly contagious.

1406
01:59:48,931 --> 01:59:52,267
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1407
01:59:53,352 --> 01:59:55,311
It can grow to define...

1408
01:59:56,355 --> 01:59:57,939
...or destroy you.

1409
02:00:01,068 --> 02:00:03,820
The smallest idea, such as:

1410
02:00:04,446 --> 02:00:06,781
"Your world is not real."

1411
02:00:07,074 --> 02:00:10,827
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1412
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:16,583
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1413
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:18,543
Do you think he is?

1414
02:00:20,337 --> 02:00:23,256
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1415
02:00:24,383 --> 02:00:25,884
I know what's real, Mal.

1416
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,263
No creeping doubts?

1417
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:33,600
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1418
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:35,226
Chased around the globe...

1419
02:00:35,394 --> 02:00:38,062
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1420
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:40,857
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1421
02:00:42,484 --> 02:00:43,985
Admit it.

1422
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:48,114
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1423
02:00:48,282 --> 02:00:49,824
So choose.

1424
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:53,328
Choose to be here. Choose me.

1425
02:01:20,105 --> 02:01:21,356
You know what I have to do.

1426
02:01:21,523 --> 02:01:24,192
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1427
02:01:25,527 --> 02:01:27,070
Because you left us.

1428
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,030
- You're wrong.
- I’m not wrong.

1429
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:31,241
You're confused.

1430
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:34,410
Our children are here.

1431
02:01:35,204 --> 02:01:38,456
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1432
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:41,709
Yes, but I’m gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1433
02:01:55,349 --> 02:01:57,350
Up above?

1434
02:01:58,227 --> 02:02:01,896
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1435
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:03,773
Watch.

1436
02:02:04,275 --> 02:02:05,984
James? Phillipa?

1437
02:02:06,151 --> 02:02:08,569
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1438
02:02:08,737 --> 02:02:11,239
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1439
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:13,283
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1440
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:15,994
What if I'm what's real?

1441
02:02:17,204 --> 02:02:19,414
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1442
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,251
But what do you believe?

1443
02:02:24,211 --> 02:02:25,420
What do you feel?

1444
02:02:27,589 --> 02:02:29,007
Guilt.

1445
02:02:30,217 --> 02:02:32,427
I feel guilt, Mal.

1446
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:36,931
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1447
02:02:37,099 --> 02:02:41,352
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1448
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,063
...reminding me of the truth.

1449
02:02:44,565 --> 02:02:45,857
What truth?

1450
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:53,531
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1451
02:02:56,910 --> 02:03:00,038
You planted the idea in my mind?

1452
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:03,041
What is she talking about?

1453
02:03:03,959 --> 02:03:09,213
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1454
02:03:10,257 --> 02:03:13,217
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1455
02:03:13,969 --> 02:03:15,470
We were lost in here.

1456
02:03:16,388 --> 02:03:21,017
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1457
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:29,901
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1458
02:03:30,652 --> 02:03:34,822
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1459
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:37,909
And she couldn't break free.

1460
02:03:40,621 --> 02:03:43,331
So I decided to search for it.

1461
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:48,795
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1462
02:03:48,962 --> 02:03:50,838
And I broke in...

1463
02:03:51,423 --> 02:03:53,591
...and I planted an idea.

1464
02:03:54,343 --> 02:03:58,096
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1465
02:04:03,352 --> 02:04:05,686
That her world wasn't real.

1466
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:21,702
That death was the only escape.

1467
02:04:29,128 --> 02:04:30,878
You're waiting for a train.

1468
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:35,925
A train that'll take you far away.

1469
02:04:37,094 --> 02:04:40,096
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1470
02:04:41,223 --> 02:04:43,224
...but you can't know for sure.

1471
02:04:44,393 --> 02:04:45,935
Yet it doesn't matter.

1472
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:50,565
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1473
02:04:54,903 --> 02:04:58,948
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1474
02:04:59,116 --> 02:05:01,534
...that even after she woke...

1475
02:05:04,413 --> 02:05:06,914
That even after
you came back to reality...

1476
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:12,795
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1477
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:17,967
That death was the only escape.

1478
02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:20,803
Mal, no! Jesus!

1479
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:24,682
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1480
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:26,267
You betrayed me.

1481
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:30,771
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1482
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:33,983
We can still be together, right here...

1483
02:05:34,151 --> 02:05:36,611
...in the world we built together.

1484
02:06:57,442 --> 02:06:59,777
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1485
02:07:00,654 --> 02:07:01,946
You can't have him.

1486
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:06,409
- lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1487
02:07:10,872 --> 02:07:12,707
Fischer is on the porch.

1488
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:15,876
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1489
02:07:16,044 --> 02:07:18,713
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1490
02:07:34,354 --> 02:07:37,440
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1491
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:41,277
You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1492
02:07:43,864 --> 02:07:46,574
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1493
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:50,244
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1494
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:55,333
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1495
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:58,919
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1496
02:07:59,087 --> 02:08:00,421
No.

1497
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:03,007
I wish.

1498
02:08:04,593 --> 02:08:07,094
I wish more than anything, but...

1499
02:08:08,221 --> 02:08:10,931
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1500
02:08:11,099 --> 02:08:13,643
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1501
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,770
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1502
02:08:15,937 --> 02:08:17,772
Look at you.

1503
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:23,944
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1504
02:08:24,404 --> 02:08:27,031
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1505
02:08:27,866 --> 02:08:30,284
...I’m sorry, you're just not good enough.

1506
02:08:30,452 --> 02:08:32,119
Does this feel real?

1507
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:37,124
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1508
02:08:45,717 --> 02:08:47,426
No, no, no!

1509
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,805
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1510
02:09:35,642 --> 02:09:37,518
I was dis --

1511
02:09:39,229 --> 02:09:41,564
I was dis – Disa --

1512
02:09:42,441 --> 02:09:44,984
- I know, Dad.
- Dis --

1513
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:53,075
I know you were disappointed...

1514
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,244
...I couldn't be you.

1515
02:09:55,662 --> 02:09:57,163
No.

1516
02:09:57,664 --> 02:09:58,873
No, no, no.

1517
02:09:59,916 --> 02:10:01,917
I was disappointed...

1518
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:05,588
...that you tried.

1519
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:30,529
What?

1520
02:10:39,956 --> 02:10:41,081
Come on, come on.

1521
02:11:11,321 --> 02:11:12,822
Dad?

1522
02:11:51,152 --> 02:11:54,238
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1523
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:10,504
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1524
02:12:10,672 --> 02:12:12,339
I will!

1525
02:12:52,505 --> 02:12:55,257
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1526
02:12:55,425 --> 02:12:56,550
Yes.

1527
02:12:56,718 --> 02:12:59,762
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1528
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:03,974
But we did.

1529
02:13:05,894 --> 02:13:08,270
We did. You don't remember?

1530
02:13:12,943 --> 02:13:15,778
I miss you more than I can bear...

1531
02:13:18,156 --> 02:13:20,157
...but we had our time together.

1532
02:13:21,493 --> 02:13:23,577
And I have to let you go.

1533
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:27,456
I have to let you go.

1534
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:20,009
I'm sorry, Robert.

1535
02:14:47,662 --> 02:14:51,331
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1536
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:54,460
...not just to live for him.

1537
02:14:56,046 --> 02:14:58,589
That's what I’m gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1538
02:15:08,349 --> 02:15:09,600
What happened?

1539
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:11,769
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1540
02:15:11,936 --> 02:15:13,187
No, to find Saito.

1541
02:15:15,482 --> 02:15:17,232
He'll be lost.

1542
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:21,612
No, he'll be all right.

1543
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:39,588
Have you come to kill me?

1544
02:15:43,885 --> 02:15:46,345
I'm waiting for someone.

1545
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:53,560
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1546
02:15:56,314 --> 02:15:57,731
Cobb?

1547
02:15:59,651 --> 02:16:01,401
Impossible.

1548
02:16:01,945 --> 02:16:04,571
We were young men together.

1549
02:16:06,157 --> 02:16:08,492
I'm an old man.

1550
02:16:09,744 --> 02:16:11,787
Filled with regret.

1551
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:17,626
Waiting to die alone.

1552
02:16:20,797 --> 02:16:22,965
I've come back for you.

1553
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:30,097
To remind you of something.

1554
02:16:33,393 --> 02:16:35,769
Something you once knew.

1555
02:16:38,606 --> 02:16:40,858
That this world is not real.

1556
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:50,284
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1557
02:16:51,119 --> 02:16:53,871
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1558
02:16:59,961 --> 02:17:01,295
Come back...

1559
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:07,217
...so we can be
young men together again.

1560
02:17:10,972 --> 02:17:12,973
Come back with me.

1561
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:17,477
Come back.

1562
02:17:27,238 --> 02:17:28,947
Hot towel, sir?

1563
02:17:29,574 --> 02:17:32,451
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1564
02:17:32,619 --> 02:17:34,912
Do you need immigration forms?

1565
02:17:36,998 --> 02:17:38,332
Thank you.

1566
02:17:38,833 --> 02:17:40,459
Hot towel, sir?

1567
02:17:41,461 --> 02:17:44,463
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1568
02:18:55,827 --> 02:18:56,910
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1569
02:18:58,037 --> 02:18:59,663
Thank you, sir.

1570
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:45,083
Welcome.

1571
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:46,960
This way.

1572
02:20:08,149 --> 02:20:11,610
James? Phillipa?

1573
02:20:15,323 --> 02:20:16,615
Look who's here.

1574
02:20:22,205 --> 02:20:23,288
Hey.

1575
02:20:24,373 --> 02:20:27,084
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

1576
02:20:27,251 --> 02:20:29,503
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1577
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:32,214
Look what I’ve been building!

1578
02:20:32,381 --> 02:20:36,093
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

1579
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:39,137
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1580
02:20:39,305 --> 02:20:41,848
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
